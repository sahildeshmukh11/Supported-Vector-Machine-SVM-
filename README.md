Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Iris Dataset
Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a classic and widely-used dataset in machine learning, ideal for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species:

Iris setosa

Iris versicolor

Iris virginica

Each sample has four numeric features representing physical measurements of the flowers:

Feature	Description	Unit
Sepal length	Length of the sepal	centimeters
Sepal width	Width of the sepal	centimeters
Petal length	Length of the petal	centimeters
Petal width	Width of the petal	centimeters

The goal is to classify iris species based on these measurements.

SVM Implementation

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to classify the Iris species. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets (70% train, 30% test), and the model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
